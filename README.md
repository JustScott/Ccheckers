# Ccheckers
A lightweight checkers logic engine and UI

<br>

### Purpose of the project
I created this project to help me learn the basics of C, which it has done perfectly.

### Goal of this project
To have a lightweight checkers logic engine and UI that's small enough to run on something like
the [Pinetime](https://www.pine64.org/pinetime/), and flexible enough to run on a desktop.

### Build Process
```bash
make          # Creates the executable(s)
make clean    # Removes the executable(s)
make run      # Runs the executable(s)
make refresh  # Cleans, creates, & runs the executable(s)
```
